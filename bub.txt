Trading with the Natives

Introduction: Today, we will be acting out how the settlers were taught survival skills and how they traded with the Natives in Jamestown around 1607.


Script

Native: Hi! What are you doing with that horse?

Settler: We’re so hungry we’re having to eat our horses! Can you help us?

Native: Here, we will help you.

Settler: Thank you so much!

Native: This is how you fish, scoop! We can also show you how to plant tobacco, and the “three sisters”:  corn, beans, and squash. 

Settler: Thank you! Here, we have some copper for jewelry, would you like to trade with us?

Native: Ok, let’s do it!

Narrator: And then they trade and the settlers survive long enough until the ship of women arrives to make new babies.
